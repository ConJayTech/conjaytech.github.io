## Technical Writing Portfolio

### About Me

I am a Technical Writer with experience in the food and production industry where I've written procedural SOPs and how-to guides for data management software.

I also have some experience writing short code samples and working in a docs-as-code environment. I have contributed to open source projects and written API documentation.

I am interested in growing my career in the tech industry, learning more about software development, and most importantly writing documentation!

### Writing Samples

#### API Documentation

As part of a certification course offered by the University of Washington, I participated in an open-source style project where I contributed to a mock REST API documentation set. This involved using a docs-as-code workflow, making pull requests along with 20 or so other students to a large collaborative project, administering usability tests, and interviewing SMEs.

For the capstone project in this course I wrote documentation for an imagined API called `Visual Chronicle` in collaboration with a classmate who acted as SME. This documentation was iteratively developed using git and GitHub. It was peer reviewed and usability tested throughout its development.

* [`User` Resource PATCH Document](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/api/users-change-user-property)
    * A reference document for updating `user` properties with either a JSON or cURL request. 
* [Quickstart Tutorial: Enroll a New User](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/tutorials/quickstart-add-user)
    * A user-friendly tutorial on how to enroll a new `user` resource with the Postman app.
* [`Watch History` Resource Reference Doc](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/api/watch-history)
    * A reference document for the service's `watch history` resource. 

#### Web Development

I have completed the Fundamentals courses in the [Odin Proejct](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a self-directed web development program. These courses start with the basics of HTML and CSS, and then introduce JavaScript. One of my projects included writing a simple rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript.

Working through this program has improved my abilities to write and understand short code samples, and how to iteratively improve on and troubleshoot coding projects with a command line interface and git environment.
