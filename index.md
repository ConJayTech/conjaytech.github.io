# Technical Writing Portfolio

## About Me

I am a Technical Writer with experience writing API documentation. I have written extensive reference guides and tutorial pages that include code samples.

I also have experience publishing static web pages that I have designed, styled, and deployed. This documentation management has involved using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create responsive and beautiful documentation. 

## Projects

### IQM API

[IQM Docs](https://conjaytech.github.io/docs/)

As the sole technical writer for [IQM](https://iqm.com/) I translated opaque OpenAPI Specification (OAS) documentation into user-friendly guidelines. I meticulously rewrote the documentation for every endpoint, ensuring every resource and property was sufficiently outlined and defined.

Since the OAS contained many errors and incompletely documented endpoints, I worked closely with the developer team to fill in the gaps.

Once I had established a working set of documentation, I published it using Docusaurus. Using my web design skills I modeled the site's style and formatting to resemble the highest quality API documentation in the industry. This was done to both make it familiar to users who have interacted with other API documentation and for its visually ergonomic way of conveying API reference material.

### API Documentation Certification Course

[Certification Badge](https://badgr.com/public/assertions/vBsXChlGRT-mPuc91TIEYw)

As part of a certification course offered by the University of Washington I participated in an open source style project where I contributed to a mock REST API documentation set. This involved using a docs-as-code workflow, making pull requests along with 20 or so other students to a large collaborative project, administering usability tests, and interviewing SMEs.

For the capstone project in this course I wrote documentation for an imagined API called [**Visual Chronicle**](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/) in collaboration with a classmate who acted as SME. I iteratively developed this documentation using git and GitHub.

* ["User" Resource PATCH Document](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/api/users-change-user-property)
    * A reference document for updating "user" Properties with either a JSON or cURL request.
* [Quickstart Tutorial: Enroll a New User](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/tutorials/quickstart-add-user)
    * A user-friendly tutorial on how to enroll a new "user" resource with the Postman app.
* ["Watch History" Resource Reference Doc](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/api/watch-history)
    * A reference document for the service's "watch history" resource.

### Web Development

I have completed the Fundamentals courses in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/): a self-directed web development program. These courses start with the basics of HTML and CSS, and then introduce JavaScript. One of my projects included writing a simple rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript.

Working through this program has improved my abilities to write and understand short code samples. I also learned how to iteratively improve on and troubleshoot coding projects with a command line interface and git environment.
