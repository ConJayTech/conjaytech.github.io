# Technical Writing Portfolio

## About Me

I am a Technical Writer with experience in the food and production industry where I've written Operations Documentation and how-to guides for data management software.

I also have experience writing short code samples and working with docs-as-code tools. I have contributed to open source projects and written API documentation.

I am eager to grow my career in the tech industry, learn more about software development, and most importantly, write documentation!

## Projects

### API Documentation

[Certification Badge](https://badgr.com/public/assertions/vBsXChlGRT-mPuc91TIEYw)

As part of a certification course offered by the University of Washington, I participated in an open-source style project where I contributed to a mock REST API documentation set. This involved using a docs-as-code workflow, making pull requests along with 20 or so other students to a large collaborative project, administering usability tests, and interviewing SMEs.

For the capstone project in this course I wrote documentation for an imagined API called [**Visual Chronicle**](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/) in collaboration with a classmate who acted as SME. This documentation was iteratively developed using git and GitHub. It was peer reviewed and usability tested throughout its development.

* ["User" Resource PATCH Document](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/api/users-change-user-property)
    * A reference document for updating "user" Properties with either a JSON or cURL request.
* [Quickstart Tutorial: Enroll a New User](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/tutorials/quickstart-add-user)
    * A user-friendly tutorial on how to enroll a new "user" resource with the Postman app.
* ["Watch History" Resource Reference Doc](https://conjaytech.github.io/visual-chronicle/api/watch-history)
    * A reference document for the service's "watch history" resource.

### Web Development

I have completed the Fundamentals courses in the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a self-directed web development program. These courses start with the basics of HTML and CSS, and then introduce JavaScript. One of my projects included writing a simple rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript.

Working through this program has improved my abilities to write and understand short code samples, and how to iteratively improve on and troubleshoot coding projects with a command line interface and git environment.
